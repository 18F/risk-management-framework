Government information systems must follow a risk management framework described by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The framework is a cycle of activities that an agency needs to perform on all information security systems:

1. [**Categorize:**](../categorize/) Define the level of risk the system presents — low, moderate, or high — based on a worst case scenario.
1. [**Select:**](../select/) Choose baseline security controls and any guidance or supplement controls based on the categories.
1. **Implement:** Put the controls in place using appropriate engineering practices. *See [SP 800-70](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-70/sp800-70r3_draft.pdf).*
1. **Assess:** Determine how effective the controls are. *See [SP 800-53A](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53Ar4.pdf).*
1. [**Authorize:**](../authorize/) Review the risks to the system and, if they are acceptable, authorize the system.
1. [**Monitor:**](../monitor/) Track changes that affect security controls and reassess how effective they are.

Continuous monitoring leads the agency back into the cycle, reviewing whether new information requires new categories, controls, or assessment criteria.

The risk management framework describes specific categories or levels of risk that a system can pose to the government, and it recommends specific baseline controls based on a system’s risk level. Agencies determine much of the process for themselves, including how to analyze risk, how to demonstrate selected controls, and whether and how to exceed the baseline recommendations. One of the key components of the framework is that the final step, monitoring, is continuous.

OMB and NIST have directed agencies to change how they approach risk management frameworks from point-in-time accreditation and authorization reviews to continuous monitoring of information system security. Here we provide a high-level overview of why this has changed and how to make continuous review work for your systems, your development teams, and your information security teams.
