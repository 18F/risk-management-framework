title: Risk management framework step 5: Authorize
---

While agencies have a lot of flexibility in how they implement the risk management framework, all of them need to include formal authorization of the system before it is operational. This is as true for continuous monitoring as it was for point-in-time documentation.

## What is Authority to Operate?
Authority to Operate (ATO) is the usual name for the result of this step. It is the last step in the risk management framework before a system is operational. (Monitoring happens during operation.) ATOs usually take the form of a document describing the risks to the government of that system, the controls that are in place to safeguard it, and the acceptance of the risks it presents.

In authorizing an information system to operate, NIST requires a senior official to explicitly accept the risks of the system and its controls. Although the term “Authority to Operate” is not described in law, the ATO is the term applied to how the official accepts those risks.

## Defining the ATO process
The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at each agency and the head of that agency define the processes by which the agency will review information system security. How this is structured depends on a number of things, such as the agency's willingness to take on risk and what kind of demonstration they expect for controls. To receive an ATO, the developers of a system must show how the system meets the controls that apply to it. (How they demonstrate that is also part of this defined process.)

Traditionally, the way to demonstrate controls is in a single document. It describes each risk and the controls in place for that risk. These documents can be dozens or hundreds of pages, and they usually describe how each control is implemented. Auditors can review these documents quickly and easily against the requirements and recommended controls from NIST, but they can be difficult to assemble from the broader systems developers have created.
