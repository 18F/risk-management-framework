title: Adopting the risk management framework
---

The risk management framework is a framework, not a policy. Frameworks have to be implemented. The way we implement needs to overcome issues with point-in-time ATO documentation while maintaining its strengths.

## Goals

The solution an agency adopts should:

* Address the shortcomings of assessment and accreditation.
* Get to ATO efficiently.
* Allow data and tools to flow between organization policy-setting and information systems.

## Continuous monitoring

[OMB has directed agencies to adopt Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM).](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2014/m-14-03.pdf) Continuous monitoring requires ongoing awareness of vulnerabilities and threats. These cannot be assessed at a single point in time in order to produce an ATO and then trusted until the next ATO review or reauthorization. [NIST’s Special Publication 800-137 describes implementation of ISCM.](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-137/SP800-137-Final.pdf)

## An organization-wide approach

Among the requirements is whole-organization involvement:

 > Maintaining an up-to-date view of information security risks across an organization is a complex, multifaceted undertaking. It requires the involvement of the entire organization, from senior leaders providing governance and strategic vision to individuals developing, implementing, and operating individual information systems in support of the organization’s core missions and business functions.

NIST uses three tiers to describe how the organization should integrate monitoring into their systems. In Tier 1, the agency should set its risk tolerance, governance, policies, and strategies. In Tier 2, the agency should set business processes that can support these organizational goals. In Tier 3, the agency needs information systems that provide the data for these processes. Data moves from the systems into the processes into the organization. Tools and capabilities flow from the organization into the processes into the systems.

## Structured data

A modern implementation of the risk management framework needs to support this movement of information. To do this, agencies need to integrate the development of secure systems with how that security is documented. To keep data moving from systems to the organization, the agency needs to produce consistently up-to-date documentation that is reliable. To make tools available to systems at the right time, the agency needs to restrict pace of development as little as possible.

If documentation of security controls is _part of_ documenting how the system itself works,
